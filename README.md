# TurinBiotronicsProject

This repository was created to share the project scripts, CAD Design Files and experimentally acquired data for the project developed by the Turin Biotronics team for the Bionics For Tomorrow contest, a team competition born from a Camplus College and MIT Univerisity collaboration.

Additional information is found in the report also available in this repository material.

## Scripts
The content of the three Raspberry folders should be entirely put on the corresponding Raspberry Pi Pico W board through the Thonny IDE App.

The CentralSubscriber script can be run on any device able to run Python scripts and connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the three boards.

### Apple Shortcut Routine
The Voice Assistant activated rotuine can be tested on IOS devices by following these steps:
1. Download the a-Shell App from AppStore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438
2. Download the shortcut file "Osteoporosis Routine" on the mobile device and open it in the Shortcuts App
3. Download the CentralSubscriber.py script and place it in the a-Shell folder using the Files app
4. The routine can be called through Siri by clicking on the play button in the Shortcut App or by saying outloud the phrase: "Hey Siri, Osteoporosis Routine"
Optional:
5. Choose a custom name for the Shortcut automation, thus allowing to use a custom activation phrase
6. Choose a custom sound to play the routine notification sounds by modifying the Shortcut action "Play Sound" 


## CAD
The CAD was developed using Solidworks 2023 and all the files are available for browsing and for additive manufacturing purposes.
The EMG_case folder contains the EMG system assembly with all the parts needed. The same holds for the IMU system assembly contained in the corresponding folder IMU_case.
